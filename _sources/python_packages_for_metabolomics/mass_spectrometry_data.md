# Processing chromatography-mass spectrometry data


|Name Package | Description| 
|:-----------:|:----------:|
| MSHub       |Imports data from multiple netCDF files to hdf5 database file, intra-sample (within sample) m/z peaks drift correction, ion Chromatogram noise filtering and baseline correction, inter-sample (between samples) chromatographic peak alignment, efficient detection of chromatographic peaks, total Ion Chromatogram visualization | 
| PythoMS     | Generates reconstructed single ion monitoring traces, overlays a predicted isotope pattern on input mass sprectum, generates a series of images showing mass spectrum and traces which can be combined into a video and renders a series of images which zoom into the y-axis to illustrate the dynamic range of mass spectrometers |
| pyMSA       | Python module to analyze the quality of MS/MS (Tandem Mass Spectrometry) spectra : Handles files mzML, peaks.mzML, featureXML, trafoXML; functions for easy retrieval of spectra, peaks and features through the handles; an easy way to fill an SQLite database with information on spectra, features and feature transversion per msrun; R plots to plot results; SQLite and MySQL database logic for fast querying between MS/MS results.  |
